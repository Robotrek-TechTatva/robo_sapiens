Write the Arduino code for 3 LEDs that light up sequentially with the
frequency based on the input from a potentiometer.

For example if the three LEDs are A, B and C, then they should light up one
after the other in a loop. A->B->C->B->A->B and so on.

The delay between the lighting of two conseuqutive LEDs should depend on the
position of potentiometer. Turning it clockwise should increase the frequency,
and and turning it anti-clockwise should have the opposite effect.
