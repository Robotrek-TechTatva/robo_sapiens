At 0 velocity, the robot gets wet from top by some constant amount and not from the front.
While travelling at any speed it gets equally wet from top because even though it may be 
avoiding the drops that are top of it in a moment but gets wet by the drops that are on top 
of it in the next moment. Therefore no matter the speed, the amount of rain it gets from 
top remains constant.
Now at 0 velocity, the amount of rain it gets from front may be 0 but when it goes from point
 A to B it gets wet by the rain drops in front and the number of drops it gets per metre 
 remains almost constant as long as it is in motion, no matter the speed because at low speed 
 it hits lesser drops but for more time in a mertre and at high speeds it hits same number of 
 drops, just faster.
 Therefore, the longer it stands in the rain, the more damage it receives.
A velocity command value of 10 is the apt solution here.
