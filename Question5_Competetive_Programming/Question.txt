Write a C/C++/Python program to find the winner of a tennis match given
an array that describes whether a point was won or lost for each player.

Example: Assume 2 players A & B. If A won the 1st, 2nd, and 4th
points, their array would look like: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0…...]
and B’s array would be the complement, ie: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1…...]

Input: Name of .csv file of random number of rows n such that
24<n<500
Output: Winner of match, A or B.
