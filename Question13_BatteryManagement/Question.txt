Which of the following are the reasons for cell imbalancing
a) cellâ€™s SOH diverge from another
b)cells having different net current from each other.
c)A cell with high resistance will tend to hit an upper/ lower voltage limit before other cells, so will limit available pack power
d)different cell resistances cause cell voltages under load to be quite different.
e) different cells having different coulombic efficiency
