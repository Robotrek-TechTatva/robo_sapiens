Write the C/C++/Python program to define F(n) to be the number of integers x<=n that can be written
in the form x=(a^2)(b^3), where a and b are integers not necessarily different and both greater than 1.

Example: 32=2^3 * 2^2 and 72=3^2 * 2*3 are the only two numbers like this less than 100
and hence F(100)=2.

Input: n such that 0<n<2499
Output: x
