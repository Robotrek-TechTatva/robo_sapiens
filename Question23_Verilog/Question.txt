Write RTL description and testbench for an Arithmetic Logic Unit using
arithmetic and logical operators. The block diagram and instructions set for ALU are shown below.

The ALU performs 16 different operations using command input Basicon
8 bit inputs a and b. If the MSB of the command input is low then the
rithmetic operations are performed. If the MSB of command input is high
then the logical operations are performed. The output is of 16 bit. I
nput oe enables the ALU, i.e. when oe is low, output is at high impedance.
