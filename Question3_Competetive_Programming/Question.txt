Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane,
for which -100 ≤ x, y ≤ 100, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:
A(-34,49), B(-15,-91), C(83,-95)
X(-18,4), Y(-42,-71), Z(57,-65)

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin,
whereas triangle XYZ does not.

Write a C/C++/Python program to count the number of triangles T that contain
the origin from the contents of a .csv file.

Input: Name of .csv file
Output: T
