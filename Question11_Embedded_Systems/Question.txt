Write the Arduino code with 3 LEDs for a 3 bit binary counter.

Use a pushbutton as input. The press of the pushbutton to increment the output
by 1, and the corresponding result should display in 3-bit binary on the LEDs.

Glowing LED: 1
Unlit LED: 0

Once the number reaches 111, pressing of the pushbutton should reset the system
and bring the output back to 000.
