In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which
is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty, with two
additional sections 25 (bullseye) and 50 (double bullseye) at the centre.

Each numbered section (from 1-20) is further divided into 3 segments:
single, double, and triple. As their names suggest, depending on where you
land on these three segments, the points allocated for that section (1-20)
remain the same, are doubled, or are tripled.

The game generally starts at 301 or 501 points, with the player being required
to hit the target and subtract the received points accordingly till they reach
EXACTLY 0.

For example, consider the middle of a game where a player is currently at
66 points. One of the many possible sequences of points to reach exactly 0
from here is:

1. D10 (brings score to 46)
2. T6 (brings score to 28)
3. Bullseye (brings score to 3)
4. S3

Write a C/C++/Python program that takes the present score n of a player as input
and gives the total number of ways x in which the player can reach exacty 0 in not
more than 11 attempts. The above example had 4 attempts.

Input: n such that 0<n<301
Output: x
